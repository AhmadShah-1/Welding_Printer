This welding robot requires you to manually point and direct the robot to where you want to weld, maps it to a coordinate system and welds it after

the nozzle of the robot is used to feel the where the item begins and ends and then welds 
they also included using a laser sensors for the robot to see but they didnt go into depth, seems to be used to detect seams and not overall design

This would be the closest competitor however, the robot is very expensive, furthermore although marketed to be very easy to use, a guided expert was still needed, and "you only need a welding expert, that you likely already have ". Addiotnally, a preexisting 3d model is required of the object, or a trained operator must manually apply parameters

They have systems using a camera system and laser scanner.




Issues with current market robots:
1. Requires trained engineers 
2. non-versatile (different robots are needed for different sized applications)
3. Not cost-effective
4. Non-hobbyist 

Hobbyists and general manufacturing sends parts to be welded by their team


My product:
Will have a design similar to that of a
